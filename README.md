# `ida-venv` playground

A toy repository to help you get started with incorporating [ida-venv](https://github.com/Skwteinopteros/ida-venv)
in your IDA Pro workflows. No manual installation required.

1. Clone this repository and its submodules:

        git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/huku-/ida-venv-playground.git

2. Add required Python libraries in **requirements.txt**. For demonstration
   purposes I have only added `networkx`.

3. Write code in **env.py**. Import third-party Python libraries as you would
   normally do in a standard virtual environment.

4. Open IDA Pro <tt><u>F</u>ile</tt> &rarr; <tt>Script <u>f</u>ile...</tt> and select **main.py**

5. Enjoy and thank me later
